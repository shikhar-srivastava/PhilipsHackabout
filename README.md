# PhilipsHackathon
Creating a Private repository to store our Model code, cleaned Datasets.

It seems every participant's VMs is accessible by iterating through their private IP's.
Since, we'll avoid uploading any solutions to the VM (except perhaps for testing & execution only), this repository is henceforth to share the Competition code, datasets and the like, amongst us.

### File Structure:

    1. Datasets : Datasets from all themes from VM pushed here
    2. preprocessed : Different versions of the same dataset, edit/preprocessed be catalogued here.
    3. models : All models (pickled form and training scripts) be saved here
